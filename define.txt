Centralised Hybrid Infrastructure Monitoring with Alerting
A solution to monitor both on-premise and cloud infrastructure metrics using Grafana, Prometheus, and CloudWatch, with integrated alerting through Slack.

Overview
This project provides centralized monitoring and alerting for a hybrid infrastructure, combining on-prem Linux servers and cloud metrics. Using Grafana, it consolidates data from Prometheus, Loki, and CloudWatch to provide real-time insights and notifications.

Features
Hybrid Monitoring: Tracks both on-premise server metrics and cloud infrastructure.
Alerting Integration: Configured alerts sent to Slack for proactive response.
Modular Setup: Easily scalable across on-premise and cloud environments.
Architecture
Components Used
Grafana: Visualization and alerting tool, integrated with Slack for notifications.
Prometheus: Used for metrics collection on on-premise servers.
Promtail & Loki: Log aggregation from on-prem servers.
Node Exporter: Provides detailed hardware and OS metrics from on-prem servers.
CloudWatch: Collects metrics from cloud infrastructure.
Access Control
IAM Role: Configured to allow Grafana to access CloudWatch metrics.
IAM Policies: Limited permissions provided to access necessary metrics securely.
